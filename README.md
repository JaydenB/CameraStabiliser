# CameraStabiliser
Built to automate camera stabilisation on VFX CG Projects.
Stabilises all rotational motion of a camera around a set of 3d bundles in
world-space.

Has modes for both 2D (Film-back Offsets) and 3D (Nodal Offsets).

Re-built off ideas from an implementation of the system designed for a
2D-offset pipeline I designed back in 2019.
